# Skip Ad extension project.

This is an extension that wont completely remove Ads but make them go away faster instead. 
youtube started warnign users about banning their accounts for using adblockers all of a sudden, this kinda freaked me out since i've used the same account for maybe 10 years or more, so i embraced the ads and just went with it. i was fine for a month. but day by day i grew sick of the unnecesarily annoying ads with loud af pumped up music. so i sat down and started thinking how i would fix this.

#### The issue 💀
- chance of getting the account banned for using ad blocker

#### The solution 🧠
- watch the whole ad but make it less annoying:
  - Muting the ad.
  - Speeding up the ad video x16 times.
  - Dimming the ad video until black.
  - Having the extension detect automatically when the ad starts [WIP].

#### Current challenges 🤔
- Lack of experience developing chrome extensions
  - Injecting html into YouTube.

### Roadmap 🗺️🚀
------------
- [x] Manually skip youtube ad.
  - [x] Mute ad
  - [x] Fast forward ad
  - [ ] Automatically skip ad
  - [ ] Dim ad
 - [ ] Automatically execute on ad show up.
- [x] Turn code into chrome extension.
- [ ] publish extension to chrome store.

## How you can test it? 🥸
------------
1. Type this into the url box, ```chrome://extensions``` this extension only works for chromium based browsers, even if you dont use chrome, the url will work. 

2. Drag the ``skip-ad.crx``` file into the window 

5. Now on youtube, as soon as you encounter an Ad you can click the ```~``` key left to the ```1``` key, on your keyboard or the ```\``` key above the ```return``` key, alternative for spanish keyboards, use the ```¿``` key.
